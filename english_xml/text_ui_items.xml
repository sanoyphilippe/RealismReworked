Before the waning of the first millennium, two empires did exist here side by side—the Great Moravian Empire and the disunited Duchy of Bohemia, in which the Přemylid dynasty did reign supreme and Saint Wenceslas, the patron saint of the land, did hail from this lineage, as did his brother Boleslaus I, who solidified power and unified the land. His son, Boleslaus II, did promote the parish of Prague into the Diocese of Prague, and thus the land did join the Holy Roman Empire, although no ruler of the Přemyslid lineage had yet received the title of king. The first to do so was Vratislaus II, who in the year of our Lord 1086, for coming to the aid of the emperor during the attack on Milan, did earn himself the crown, but his progeny did not have such fortune until Ottakar defended his inherited right to the crown. It would have been natural for him to then occupy the neighbouring land of Moravia, but he did not, for he wisely and peacefully charged his son with administering this land and thus did make of Moravia a March, which later became not an imperial fiefdom but a royal fiefdom, belonging to the Bohemian Crown.&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt; &amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;    But the Přemyslids were not meant to rule for long, for a murderer’s hand did intervene and this great dynasty was slayed by the sword and the empty throne did then fall to the Luxembourgs, who did annex to this country other territories of great size, so that the Kingdom of Bohemia nearly stretched from sea to sea. The most famed of kings of Bohemia, and the King of the Romans in the same man, was Charles IV of Luxembourg, who did establish great wealth and bounty for the entire land and its fame did spread, for he did promote the diocese to an archdiocese and did command for a great University at Prague to be built and a New Town with a stone bridge to connect it to the Old.

Before the waning of the first millennium, two empires did exist here side by side—the Great Moravian Empire and the disunited Duchy of Bohemia, in which the Přemylid dynasty did reign supreme and Saint Wenceslas, the patron saint of the land, did hail from this lineage, as did his brother Boleslaus I, who solidified power and unified the land. His son, Boleslaus II, did promote the parish of Prague into the Diocese of Prague, and thus the land did join the Holy Roman Empire, although no ruler of the Přemyslid lineage had yet received the title of king.

Jobst of Moravia stood at the head of the discontent lords and with support from most of the Moravian dukes, he began to openly rebel against the king and did ally himself with Sigismund of Hungary. This act of rebellion was not so much about the Bishop’s estates, but about who would rule Bohemia and Moravia—Wenceslas or Sigismund.

Unto them was born a son and they gave unto him the name of Wenceslas. After his father’s untimely death, he was to sit upon the throne, but having yet been grown of age, his mother ruled the land in his stead and it was his grandmother Ludmila who cared for his upbringing. His brother was Boleslaus and they grew up together, although they had little in common. Through God’s mercy, Wenceslas learned to read and write. Being learned of books and firm of faith, he could wield a sword as well. But above all it was peace and his country that he did love. He performed many kind acts unto the poor, clothing the naked and feeding the hungry, protecting the servants of God and having many churches erected. He was a paragon for his people and a ruler that was kind above others, for with his enemies he always did negotiate with good intentions and they too did kneel before his piety. With his whole heart he exalted God and the good deeds he performed were innumerable.&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt; &amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;    Thus, it was to the surprise of none that the Devil planted the seed of hatred in many corrupted men’s hearts and set them against Wenceslas. He urged them, like so many Judases, to revolt against their lord and then they did whisper to Boleslaus that his brother wished to take his life. Boleslaus, believing these words, devised a plan, out of fear and resentment, to take his brother Wenceslas’s throne as well as his life.&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt; &amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;    He knew that whenever a new church was consecrated, Wenceslas would go to that place to pray. And he did thusly when on Sunday on the Feast of Saints Cosmas and Damian he entered Boleslaus’s castle and having attended mass, he prepared to depart for Prague. His brother, detaining him, invited him to the table to drink, but Wenceslas declined. Early in the morning, Wenceslas rose and hurried to morning mass. When in front of the church gate he met his brother he said unto him “Brother, last evening you served us well.” Boleslaus then, guided by the Devil, responded thusly: “And now I shall serve you even better” and as those words left his mouth, he struck Wenceslas a blow to the head with his sword. And Boleslaus’s dogs set upon him as well and together with their master, they killed Wenceslas and left his broken body in front of the church. Boleslaus then sat upon his brother’s throne.&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt; &amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;    Today Wenceslas has already been sainted and established to be the patron saint of the lands of Bohemia.

It transpired in the year 982. Recalling to mind the words of his predecessor, that amongst the common people many injustices had spread, that polygamy amongst the nobility and blood feuds amongst the people did flourish, that no soul did honour neither Sabbath nor holy days and in their place they held markets, that Christians were sold into slavery, and that in the countryside pagan customs did flourish, he resolved to devote his life to fighting against such iniquity. For five years did he endeavour to eradicate these iniquities, but he failed, and disgusted, he travelled to Rome to beg the Holy Father for counsel. And he said unto him: “My son, if you are incapable of leading your people, then redraw and at least try to save yourself”. And he wanted to journey to Jerusalem, but it was impossible to pass himself off as a common pilgrim, for his bishop’s vestments gave him away, but cast them aside he could not. And he gave his possessions to the poor and he did cast aside his vestments, and he secluded himself in a Benedictine monastery for several years. But here as well he did see how morality had been degraded and how the monks lived a nearly earthly life and in disgust he departed and returned to pastoring and the crosier.&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt; &amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;    To rectify at least some things, he founded Brevnov Monastery as well as several others and invited monks of great morals to them to live and devote themselves to God according to the strictest monastic laws. In the year of our Lord 995 a horrible catastrophe struck his family—every last man and child was murdered at the fortified town of Libice, whence only Adalbert escaped, perhaps because he was not there or because no soul dared lay a hand upon a bishop. People evil of tongue claim that it was the Přemyslid clan that did commit this massacre to solidify its power in Bohemia. Others say that it was Adalbert himself who was responsible, for he offered an adulterous wife, who according to custom should have been killed, asylum in his church and thus the disgraced clan of the husband wanted vengeance, but not finding him at Libice, they killed his family instead.&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt; &amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;    Sorrowed and disgusted, Adalbert once again retired from his affairs and set off as a missionary to the north, to the land of the pagan Prussians. There he desired to spread the Christian faith and to fight against the pagans’ idolatry, but the local inhabitants did not wish to see him and greeted him with stones and sticks. Seeing such idolatry, he destroyed their idols and chopped down their sacred grove, for they did bow before trees and considered them to be holy. When the pagans saw this, they killed Adalbert and their trees did drink his blood and his body they left there. It was only Boleslaus the Brave who had the holy remains of this martyr taken to Prague.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;</Cell><Cell>&amp;lt;p align='center'&amp;gt;&amp;lt;font size='25'&amp;gt;On Saint Adalbert&amp;lt;/font&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p align='left'&amp;gt;    Upon the death of Bishop Dietmar, the first Bishop of the Kingdom of Bohemia, Voitek, known as Adalbert, of the Slavnik clan, took his place.

How can you so boldly bellow? &amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;
You, with no coin to your name &amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;
gaunt and afraid of the cane, &amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;
Trudging through this world in squalor,&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;
Ever burdened by your labour. &amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;
However you may toil and sweat, &amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;
No better garments shall you get. &amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;
To go in rags is a scholar’s lot, &amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;
A bed to lie on you have not. &amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;
Now you lie by the hearth at night, &amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;
But in winter you will have to fight &amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;
to warm your bones by the fireside near&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;
for they’ll drive you out without a care. &amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;
You’d be blessed to sleep on the floor at least, &amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;
Not left to lie on the earth like a beast. &amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;
Shivering on the frozen ground, &amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;
with chattering teeth and frost all round. &amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;
And still you’ll have no end to chores, &amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;
Lighting the stove and sweeping floors, &amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;
Your work may never be forgot, &amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;
although you cannot sleep a jot &amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;
when on the cold hard ground you lay. &amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;
I'm better off, I proudly say. &amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;
My bed of straw is like Paradise, &amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;
where at night I peacefully lie&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;
like a bird in a feathered nest of spruce. &amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;
Though at times I lie in dung, God’s truth. -&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;
but still I suffer little pain, &amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;
save when I am soaked by rain, &amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;
I must wait till dawn and my clothing dries, &amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;
And I wipe it clean as soon as I rise &amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;
so the cloth is clean and bright next day. &amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;
Mark my words, one thing I’ll say: &amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;
the peasants fear me to a man! &amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;
Wherever I may walk or stand, &amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;
all bow their heads before me low: &amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;
"Welcome, Master!”, they greet me so, &amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;
Even the farmer steps aside &amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;
and the chickens can hardly run and hide&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;
I’m glad of that, for if they will, &amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;
let them hide in my bag until, &amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;
I take them with me to a feast -&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;
plucked and cooked in their own grease! &amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;
One thing I’ll say, since you entreat me: &amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;
I have no fear my master will beat me. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;$new_page;

The Czechs dominate, but many a German can be found amongst merchants and tradesmen, who live in their own quarter, and even the Jews have been granted their own “town” within Prague, into which no Christian dare step foot. To celebrate the glory of God, the One and Only, monasteries were founded at Emmaus, Strahov, and Klarov, and churches of stone are so numerous that you could not count them on two hands. The greatest and most renowned of all, consecrated to Saints Vitus and Aldabert, shall soon stand, for it has been being constructed for nearly fifty years and soon shall be completed. Under Emperor Charles a University was founded as well, which provides learning in four arts, and from many distant lands do foreigners come to study. If one was to visit only one city in life, may one make haste to Prague, for there is no more beautiful city in the world.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

Starosta was a virtuous girl and did live in love of Christ, but her father, a nobleman, wished to married her to the chief of a pagan tribe in order to gain more land and to please the raiders. The wretched girl, wishing to avoid this unwanted union, began to pray and she prayed to God and to all the saints for so long that she grew a thick beard, the type which old men have, which thus prevented the wedding from occurring. The barbarian chieftan, having seen his would-be bride and her beard, one that not even he would be ashamed of, withdrew from the marriage.

In the year of our Lord 1391 he was born unto Emperor Charles IV and his wife Anna of Schweidnitz, and through the right of primogeniture did inherit the throne from his father. At the young age of but two years old he was crowned King of Bohemia and at the age of but fifteen he sat upon the throne of the emperor, both actions that aroused outcry, for to crown a new king whilst an older one is still alive is neither ordinary nor common and, all the same, the young king cannot rule until he reaches adulthood.&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt; &amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;    When later King and Emperor Charles died and Wenceslas rightfully sat upon both thrones, he ruled well at first, but poor councillors and unwise rulers of the lands of Europe did vex him greatly, and thus the king, abandoning his initial enthusiasm, turned his attention instead to drinking and hunting. And thus in the empire did discontent with the new ruler grow, and Wenceslas, instead of reconciling conflicts, fled from them, for he did not need to resolve them. And thus it came to be that he did not go to receive his crown, for he desired not to enrage the French, who at that time had their own pope in Avignon, and he did cause such indignation in the Margraviate of Moravia that Jobst of Moravia had him imprisoned, until the king resolved the troubles in his country. But in place of resolving conflicts Wenceslas’s disregard for proper rule persevered and he was freed by his brother John. Discontent grew and many other noblemen did protest and a League of Lords was formed to remove Wenceslas from the throne and on it they would have preferred to see sit his second brother, Sigismund, who ruled in Hungary at the time. Wenceslas heeded neither warning nor threats of the Lords and continued to rule as he saw fit, or rather to devote himself to amusements, and when the Lords had no more patience for him and a rebellion against him broke out, he requested the assistance of his second brother, Sigismund, to whom he entrusted rule of the land. He, however, did not help his brother, but took his royal castles and imprisoned Wenceslas, for not just rule did Sigismund take, but the crown of Bohemia as well, which a certain fraction of the Lords did welcome, for they were glad to see order and law restored in the kingdom. In these days, King Wenceslas remains Sigismund’s captive, whilst Sigismund, the Ginger Fox, plunders Bohemia. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

The test was conducted by Master Johannes Bergmann, Honourable Councillor of the City of Passau, who was entrusted with the task by the City Council and who, as a jeweller and goldsmith, has much experience in such matters. The test was supervised by the Deputies of the City Council Mssrs. Joachim Falkenberg, Konrad called Honey-Tongued and Kuno Eiser. Master Bergmann surmised that the forgeries were very well fashioned and for a layman difficult to distinguish from genuine currency. It was also found that the counterfeit had been made by a new method, as yet unfamiliar to Master Bergmann. The core of the coin is stamped from copper sheet and the same is plated with silver amalgam in imitation of the genuine article. The Master Jeweller also noted that the design of the coin is sharply etched and of fine quality, indicating that the counterfeiters had at their disposal a very well-crafted punch.</Cell><Cell>On April 2, a test was conducted in Passau of a coin, which was a forgery of the Prague Groschen recently discovered in the Passau House of Exchange.
