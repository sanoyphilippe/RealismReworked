Their Lordships were discussing high politics with none other than Margrave Jobst and planning what to do next. They agreed on one thing - that the Bohemian throne had to be restored to Wenceslas IV and Sigismund's bloody campaign brought to an end. They drafted a letter to Sir Otto of Bergow, the Supreme Prague Burgrave, a member of the League of Lords and a strong opponent of Wenceslas'. They sent Sir Hans Capon to deliver the letter.
