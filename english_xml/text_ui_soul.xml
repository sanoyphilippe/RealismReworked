You execute it by pressing the block button at the start of your opponent's strike, which you will recognise by the appearance of a green shield in the middle of the combat rose, the same as in the case of a Perfect Block. But to execute the Master Strike instead of a Perfect Block, you must react quickly and press Block right at the very start of the window of opportunity for the Perfect Block.:&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt; :&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;How long that window is open depends on the difference in level between your Weapon skill and your opponent's.
