They were directly answerable to the King and the lands in their possession were only leasehold, for which they had to pay the King his dues and were obligated to provide military assistance in the event of war. Noble status was hereditary, as were the land rights responsibilities thereto. The land came with its inhabitants, of course, who had to pay their liege Lord the rental fees and to labour on his farmlands. &lt;br/&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;br/&gt;
The oldest Czech Families include: The lords of Buzic (e.g. the Hares of Hasenburg), of Beneshov (from Dauba, from Krawarn), of Ronov (from Leipa, from Dauba) or the Rosenbergs. Even in the 14th century the term ‘Lord’ was reserved for the wealthy members of the higher nobility, who had the right to elect the King and sit in the Territorial Council or Landtag, but by the 15th century, their ‘Lordships’ had come to include not only the sovereign and senior clerics and nobles, but also the municipality governing members and even ordinary townspeople. 
&lt;br/&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;br/&gt;
A Squire (Zeman) was a provincial nobleman, of local origin, long-established in a given territory. a Baronet (Vladyka) administered numerous estates. Yeomen, who formed the lower nobility, had no property of their own and served the higher nobility. &lt;br/&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;br/&gt;
Trends in the arts were influenced by higher and later by lower nobility, since they were often the sponsors of artistic works. This applied not only to buildings, paintings or sculptures, but also garment accessories, hairstyles and furniture. A nobleman didn’t have to be an educated person, it was quite enough that he had a military upbringing; he had his subjects and servants to take care of administration and physical work. His main duties were the collection of taxes, managing the militia and all offices of heritage.

Initially the term baker referred not so much to the man who baked, but the one who took the pastries to market. Over time, they specialized in the baking itself and acquired guild status, which, of course led to the rights disputes, because the bakers objected to pastries and bread being sold at markets by country-folk not in the guild. It was only later that the regulations were laid down to make the sale of bread the exclusive domain of the guilds.
&lt;br/&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;br/&gt;
The quality of baked goods was supervised by Councillors, or the municipal mesurier. If the flour was bad, they didn’t like its colour or the baker scrimped on weight, he was fined. If there were recurrences, he was expelled from the guild and made to suffer cruel physical punishment. Apparently King Wenceslaus himself used to go to the municipal market to oversee the quality of Prague baked goods, and punished dishonest bakers by publicly dunking them in the Vltava River.&lt;br/&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;br/&gt;

The inaccessibility of the sacred ritual, along with disgust at the state of the Church, later led to the revolutionary Hussite reform movement, which opened up both the mass and the Eucharist rites to the wider populace.

<Row><Cell>ui_codex_cont_bojova_technika</Cell><Cell>During the high Middle Ages new elements of combat techniques as well as weapons and armour were coming into their own. The curved sabre grew in popularity, chain mail gave way to plate armour. Knights took to heavier longswords, crossbows and strike weapons such as maces, flails, etc. A complete armour suit of armour was affordable only for a wealthy nobleman. Most often the armour worn gave only partial metal cover, more reliance being given to good combat technique for protection. &lt;br/&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;br/&gt;
Accordingly, sword-fighting developed in two directions:&lt;br/&gt;
a) Knightly swordsmanship – fought with a spear, sword and shield in full heavy armour&lt;br/&gt;
b) commoner swordsmanship – for lightly armoured footsoldiers, who fought with a sword and home-made weapons e.g. a dagger, flail, scythe or bludgeon etc. &lt;br/&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;br/&gt;

In combat between the lightly armoured and the ironclads it was often swiftness, agility and cunning that made the difference. Hence swordplay and fencing drew interest in the poorer echelons of society. Over time they gained their skills in fencing schools. The training was not very professional, based more on agility, readiness and use of all and any advantageous resources available apart from weapons. Accurate period descriptions of battles are lacking, so historians rely on records preserved in the literature or illustrated material.

</Cell><Cell>Medieval town society was made up largely of craftsmen and merchants, who ensured its socio-economic growth. Based on their freeman rights they could exercise their craft and had the right to market. In addition to privileges such as the protection of and support for the town’s operation, health care and food provision, it was their duty to pay taxes on every sale or transport of goods outside the town limits. In essence the status of the municipality was dependent on them, hence it was important that they did not relocate and ply their trade elsewhere, passing their occupation on to following generations.

In the space of one century, several craftsmen of the same profession would be active in a town. These artisans gradually began to form themselves into groups with political and economic rules, or members’ guilds. They had their seals of office and pennants bearing the guild crests granted by the monarch. Each member of a guild had the support of the others, and they all agreed on prices and the regulation of sales, and the rules for apprenticeship and discharging their duties. No one without guild membership could trade in goods.

<Row><Cell>ui_codex_cont_crime</Cell><Cell>The crimes considered most severe crimes were murder, incest, counterfeiting money, sorcery, robbery and a larger-scale theft. Smaller, but still officially dealt-with offences included disorderly conduct, public drunkenness, fraud, non-payment of debts, slander and libel. &lt;br/&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;br/&gt;
Capital crimes were punished by hanging (the most common form of execution of men, mainly for recurring crimes) or by beheading (reserved for the nobility).  For aggravated murder the punishment was the breaking wheel, which was left on the gallows hill complete with the corpse, as a warning, until the body decomposed completely. Other options for execution were burning at the stake (for heretics and forgers), being drawn by horses, quartered, or impaled. Women were typically drowned, or in retribution for killing a newborn, buried alive. Before execution the offender might first lose their right hand, chopped off on the block. For felonies, punished was meted out even on the way to the scaffold – the criminals were dragged behind a horse, tied by the legs or in a sack made of cowhide. &lt;br/&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;br/&gt;
Some wrongdoing was redeemable for cash – these were less serious offences, the fine levied went to the town coffers, or a part went to the aggrieved party in compensation. Redeeming oneself for murder was possible, but entailed paying recompense (‘weregild’) to the survivors, and putting up a conciliation cross. &lt;br/&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;br/&gt;
The nobility was virtually beyond the reach of justice and the bailiffs had no power to touch them, even for felonies. Only the King could condemn and punish them (which did indeed happen). &lt;br/&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;br/&gt;
Some public order offences were punished by public contempt, in the stocks on the town square. Worse than the ridicule was the guilty party’s lifelong loss of honour, also dragging down their family. &lt;br/&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;br/&gt;
Generally though, it can be said that in times of peace the Middle Ages were much safer than might appear on film and in books. There was often much less crime than today.

<Row><Cell>ui_codex_cont_feudal</Cell><Cell>Feudalism is a political system based on land ownership, which originated in the early Middle Ages and followed on from the decline of the Roman Empire. Its foundation was a fiefdom (feudum), this being a certain area (territory, land) that the owner loaned out to others. The ruler – either secular or religious – was the natural feudal senior (suzerain – sovereign liege) and those afforded his fiefdoms were his fiefs or vassals. The handover itself came with pomp and ceremony, during which the vassal promised allegiance and military aid (or other services) to his feudal lord. The contract could be cancelled only by the death of one of the parties or by a material breach. Not only could the liege have several vassals, a vassal could have several liege lords. In the event of a war one had to choose sides by one’s contractual tenure. &lt;br/&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;br/&gt;
Feudalism also determined the relations of poorest layers — the serfs, who worked on the leased land, paid dues out of what they made of it and provided for their master, his soldiers and officials or for the monastery.

In addition to these two traditional types we also recognize weapons for striking, hurling, hand firearms, artillery, and positional. In the Middle Ages there were also plenty of lances, halberds, and crossbows. Rural weaponry was often derived from farming tools. From the 14th century, Europe began deploying cannon, using gunpowder (long known in China) and firearms in general began to make slow inroads.

Such a well would be emptied out once a year and functioned as a storage cistern. Castle wells could reach enormous depths, in extreme cases even more than 100m deep. Well-building was very costly and not possible everywhere. It proved more effectual to build cisterns, tanks, which resembled a well, but did not have their own water source. Most often such tanks collected rain water, filtered first. &lt;br/&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;br/&gt;

Among the most popular drugs were those inducing abortion, aphrodisiacs (stimulating sexual arousal), analgesics (for pain), antiseptics (killing bacteria), digestives (to improve digestion), laxatives, narcotics (to induce sleep or with soothing effects) or tonics (to revitalize and give sustenance to the body). One of the worst cases of food poisoning that impacted the wider rural society involved rye, spoiled by the parasitic ergot fungus – before the source of the poisoning was found out, thousands of people would often be affected which often led to accusations against some local ‘witch’ (since ergot, in a sub-lethal dose, brings on delirium and hallucinations). Indeed, quite often the underlying cause of some ‘witchery’ superstitions and allegations was nothing other than intoxication by psychoactive substances sometimes used in the making of lotions and potions.

City rights were acquired by Kuttenberg in 1318, since which time the economic activity of the city was taken care of by the so-called Urburer, or Royal clerk. To keep the operation of the mint and the mines to a high standard and safe a list of legal edicts was issued, the mining regulative (Ius Regale Montanorum). 
&lt;br/&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;br/&gt;
The city soon became rich and had the same powers as the Old Town of Prague. The wealthiest inhabitants of Kuttenberg were the German population, a lower class was made up of mineworkers, smelters, moneyers, artisans or serving staff. Almost every city dweller had some connection to silver mining, minting coinage or trading.

The treasures of found and mined silver supported the development of other Czech cities, among others, the construction of new buildings in Prague.

During his reign, the former timber houses were rebuilt in brick or as half-timbered. There were also churches, a sterling court and other public works built at that time. Kuttenberg retains its Gothic genius loci to this day.

Before one’s death, one had to be absolved of sins (confession, penance) and receive last rites, and where death was neither certain, nor excluded (e.g. when going off to do battle) rites were given ‘just in case’. &lt;br/&gt; &amp;nbsp; &lt;br/&gt;
One’s final resting place was also of importance.  The best place was deemed to be inside a church (in the walls or under the floor), followed by closest proximity – hence cemeteries sprang up right next to the churches, often in the very centre of the village. A cemetery (‘consecrated soil’) became an integral part of towns and villages, a regular meeting place for people, where they even traded and made contracts.

</Cell><Cell>Records of burials are as old as mankind itself, but Christianity radically changed all the customs around interment, and linked death inextricably with religious rituals and blessings. Before one’s death, one had to be absolved of sins (by confession and penance) and receive the Last Rites, and where there was imminent likelihood of death (e.g. when going off to do battle) Extreme Unction was given ‘just in case’. &lt;br/&gt; &amp;nbsp; &lt;br/&gt;

During the high Middle Ages the ideal of beauty was a skinny, pale woman with long blonde hair, small pert breasts, not very wide hips and a narrow waist.

A light bow with the hand on the heart would befit two noblemen of equal rank. A deeper bow was a more respectful salutation (to a guest, toward someone of higher standing). The next level would be to go down on bended left knee, tilting the head. This greeting was used against toward rulers, barons or high ranking commanders and expressed allegiance. Standing up would have to wait until invited to do so by the other.

The oldest written record of Rattay dates back to the 13th century when it was the property of Přibyslav of Rattay (mentioned in records in 1263 and 1289). At about the same time, ownership of Rattay passed to Burgrave Hroznata of Úžice, whose sons held several other castles and villages in the surrounding area.&lt;br/&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;br/&gt;In 1293, King Wenceslaus II gave Rattay to Bishop Tobias (Tobiáš) of Bechyně. Then it became the property of Burgrave Hynek of Dubá who was the heir to the house of the Lords of Leipa (Lipá). Rattay experienced their greatest renown and prosperity under the administration of Henry of Leipa (died 1329), his sons and grandchildren. His son John (died 1338) was the most politically active. The municipality was also governed by Henry’s relatives, the Lords of Pirkstein, Ješek and Hanuš. Under their administration, the two castles were built, as were the churches, and the village was given strong fortifications.&lt;br/&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;br/&gt;
[Pirkstein]&lt;br/&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;br/&gt;The lower castle in Rattay, founded by Henry of Leipa before the mid-14th century (first mention dates from 1346), spreads over an island in the the middle of the Živý Stream. The castle is separated from the town by a moat. This is a bergfried type castle with a massive tower, rounded corners in the rear and three rooms on each floor.  The entire structure is surrounded by ramparts. &lt;br/&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;br/&gt;
In 1447 the castle unfortunately burned and then quickly changed owners. It suffered even greater damage during the peasant uprising in 1627. One hundred years later, from 1713–1724 it was rebuilt by Octavian Kinský into a presbytery and bell tower.&lt;br/&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;br/&gt;

The upper castle was built at the same time as the lower castle in the mid-14th century. It also burned in the same year as Pirkstein (1447). In the 16th century it was rebuilt into a Renaissance chateau and in 1672 renovated in the Baroque style. Today it houses the local town hall.
&lt;br/&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;br/&gt;[St. Matthew's Church]&lt;br/&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;br/&gt;The lower Rattay church was built in the 1460s by Ješek Ptáček of Pirkstein with his wife Anna.&lt;br/&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;br/&gt;
The church served as a presbytery along with the Church of St. Nicholas which no longer exists.  From 1675–1691 it was demolished and rebuilt in the Baroque style according to the plans of Ondřej de Guarde. It has survived in this form to the present day with just a few minor changes. The only remnants of the original church are the tombs of the estate owners, for example a tombstone with the coat of arms of the Lords of Leipa mounted into the cemetery wall, and the base of the baptismal font from 1421. The first church was probably single-bay.
&lt;br/&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;br/&gt;[St. Nicholas' Church]&lt;br/&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;br/&gt;Probably the older of the two churches within the castle walls. The first mention dates from 1343. It was located in the upper part of Rattay before the upper wall and partially served as a presbytery. Since 1336 the Korečník Mill has also belonged to the Rattay presbytery.</Cell><Cell>Rataje (Rattay) was a small market-town with two castles – the upper castle, known simply as Rattay Castle; and the lower castle, known as Pirkstein or Pirkenstein (Pirkštejn, Pirkenštejn). The oldest written record of Rattay dates back to the 13th century when it was the property of Přibyslav of Rattay (mentioned in records in 1263 and 1289). At about the same time, ownership of Rattay passed to Burgrave Hroznata of Úžice, whose sons held several other castles and villages in the surrounding area.&lt;br/&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;br/&gt;In 1293, King Wenceslas II gave Rattay to Bishop Tobias (Tobiáš) of Bechyně. Then it became the property of Burgrave Hynek of Dubá (Dauba) who was the heir to the house of the Lords of Leipa (Lipá). Rattay experienced its greatest renown and prosperity under the administration of Henry of Leipa (died 1329), his sons and grandchildren. His son John (died 1338) was the most politically active. The town was also governed by Henry’s relatives, the Lords of Pirkstein, Ješek and Hanuš. Under their administration, the two castles were built, as were the churches, and the village was given strong fortifications.&lt;br/&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;br/&gt;
[Pirkstein]&lt;br/&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;br/&gt;The lower castle in Rattay, founded by Henry of Leipa before the mid-14th century (first mention dates from 1346), spreads over an island in the middle of the Živý Stream. The castle is separated from the town by a moat. This is a bergfried type castle with a massive tower, rounded corners in the rear and three rooms on each floor. The entire structure is surrounded by ramparts. &lt;br/&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;br/&gt;
In 1447 the castle unfortunately caught fire and then quickly changed owners. It suffered even greater damage during the peasant uprising in 1627. One hundred years later, from 1713–1724, it was rebuilt by Octavian Kinský into a presbytery and bell tower.&lt;br/&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;br/&gt;

Its origins date back to the first half of the 11th century, when it was founded by Duke Oldřich at the instigation of the monk Procopius. Saint Procopius (canonised in 1204) became renowned particularly for wanting to preserve the Old Church Slavonic religious rites in the monastery, rather than adopting the Latin liturgy. According to the oldest document mentioning the construction and development of Sasau Monastery, “Vita Maior: the 11th Century Legend of Saint Procopius”, the saint initially lived in a cave before building a church consecrated to the Virgin Mary and Saint John the Baptist.&lt;br/&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;br/&gt;

<Row><Cell>ui_codex_cont_schizma</Cell><Cell>The schism in the Catholic Church was underway in the years 1378-1389, when after 70 years, the second Papal Throne was moved from Avignon back to Rome. It was also caused by Pope Urban VI. (1378-1389), who refused to share authority with the College of Cardinals. They therefore declared the election void and elected a new, second Pope Clement VII. (1378-1404), recognized by Scotland, Castile, Aragon, Navarre, and Portugal. &lt;br/&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;br/&gt;
Taking the side of Pope Urban VI were Germany, Bohemia, England and Ireland, Flanders, Poland, Hungary, and Italy. While Urban reigned in Rome, Clement was based in Avignon. &lt;br/&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;br/&gt;
The other two Popes were Boniface IX. (1389-1404) and the antipope Benedict XIII. (1394-1423). At this time European efforts to restore the unity of the Roman Catholic Church were growing. Unfortunately, neither the Council nor the Popes themselves were able to reconcile, as neither side was willing to budge from their demands. &lt;br/&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;br/&gt;
In 1409 this got to the point that the Cardinals declared both Popes invalid, and elected a third, antipope John XXIII. (1410-1415). None of the Popes allowed themselves to be unseated, however. The conflict embroiled the rulers of the various countries involved, among others Sigismund of Luxembourg, who took the side of John XXIII. &lt;br/&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;br/&gt;
The Council of Constance, convened on 5/11/1414, was supposed to be the start of Church reforms but antipope John XXIII did not participate in it and absconded. The Council approved the Decree “Haec Sancta”, that the Council has more power than the Pope. Accordingly, John XXIII was deposed and imprisoned, the Roman Pope Gregory gave up his position and the antipope Benedict XIII was deposed and sentenced for perjury. In November of the same year they elected a new Pope, Martin V. (1417-1431), based in Rome. The Decree limited his mandate, however.
</Cell><Cell>The Papal Schism or Western Schism was a rift in the Catholic Church in the Middle Ages during which there were two Papacies existing simultaneously, one in Rome and the other in Avignon, France. It began in 1378, the year after Pope Gregory XI brought the Papal Court back to Rome from Avignon, where it had resided for almost 70 years due to hostilities between the Roman Papacy and the Kingdom of France. When Gregory died, the Neapolitan Bartolomeo Prignano was elected Pope with the name Urban VI (1378-1389). He, however, quarrelled with the very College of Cardinals that had elected him. They therefore declared his election void and elected a new, second Pontiff, Pope Clement VII (1378-1404), who re-established the Papal Court in Avignon and was recognized by Scotland, Castile, Aragon, Navarre and Portugal.&lt;br/&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;br/&gt;
Siding with Pope Urban VI in Rome were Italy, Germany, Bohemia, England and Ireland, Flanders, Poland and Hungary.&lt;br/&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;br/&gt;
The Schism continued even after the death of the original rival Popes with the election of Boniface IX in Rome (1389-1404) and Benedict XIII in Avignon (1394-1423). The Popes in Avignon were called Antipopes. At this time European efforts to restore the unity of the Roman Catholic Church were growing. Unfortunately, neither the Council nor the Popes themselves were able to reconcile, as neither side was willing to budge from their demands. &lt;br/&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;br/&gt;
In 1409 the dispute escalated to the point that the Cardinals declared both Popes invalid and elected a third, the Antipope John XXIII (1410-1415). None of the Popes submitted to being dethroned, however. The conflict embroiled the rulers of the various countries involved, among others Sigismund of Luxembourg, who took the side of John XXIII. &lt;br/&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;br/&gt;
The Council of Constance was convened on November 5th, 1414 to resolve the issue. The Council secured the resignations of Antipope John XXIII and the Roman Pope Gregory XII, and in 1417 elected a new Pope, Martin V (1417-1431), based in Rome. This essentially brought an end to the Schism, although there were subsequently two more Antipopes who continued to be supported by a minority, Benedict XIV and Clement VIII, who resigned in 1429, leaving Martin V once again the sole Pontiff.

<Row><Cell>ui_codex_cont_skalice</Cell><Cell>Little is known about the war in 1402 to 1403, when Sigismund invaded the Czech lands and tried to seize power, and the records that do exist are fairly vague.  However, we do know the fate of Silberskalitz, which was burned to the ground on 23 March, 1403. We know the exact date because Sigismund signed a document while in his seige camp that shows he was at Skalitz on that day.
&lt;br/&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;br/&gt;
Sigismund undoubtedly choose Skalitz because silver was mined here and the town was administered by hetman Racek Kobyla, a supporter of the king. Sigismund apparently wanted to disrupt the flow of money going to the king.
&lt;br/&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;br/&gt;
According to legend, Kobyla and his people, who were hiding from the attackers in the castle, were able to escape because of a great storm that blew in and forced the beseigers to wait until morning to take the castle. The castle defenders took advantage of this opportunity and under the cover of darkness fled to nearby Rattay. In the morning, the only thing Sigismund's men found in the empty castle was a goat (which is also in the game). Sigismund then razed the town and the castle to the ground and the castle was never rebuilt. Today, only the foundations remain.
</Cell><Cell>Little is known about the war in 1402 to 1403, when Sigismund invaded Bohemia and tried to seize power, and the records that do exist are fairly vague. However, we do know the fate of Skalice (Silberskalitz, Silver Skalitz) which was burned to the ground on 23 March, 1403. We know the exact date because a document was preserved that Sigismund signed that day in the siege camp.
&lt;br/&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;br/&gt;
Sigismund undoubtedly choose Skalitz because silver was mined here and the town was administered by the Royal Hetman, Racek Kobyla, a supporter of the king. Sigismund apparently wanted to disrupt the flow of money going to the Wenceslas.
&lt;br/&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;br/&gt;
According to legend, Kobyla and his people, who were hiding from the attackers in the castle, were able to escape because of a great storm that blew up and forced the besieging army to wait until morning to take the castle. The castle defenders took advantage of the opportunity and under the cover of darkness fled to nearby Rattay. In the morning, the only thing Sigismund's men found in the empty castle was a goat (this is also in the game). Sigismund then razed the town and the castle to the ground and the castle was never rebuilt. Today, only the foundations remain.

<Row><Cell>ui_codex_cont_taboreni</Cell><Cell>In the Middle Ages countries were constantly being crossed by various sized marauding groups of soldiers, brigands, guardsmen or lone combatants, who would often change where they were staying. They lived in makeshift huts, shelters or tents around a central fire. Some stayed at one camp for several days, others set up camp always only for the night and moved on again the next day. One important factor for their choice of campsite was the ready availability of water, food, animal fodder and firewood. Very rarely they camped in villages or at a castle and its surroundings. This was reserved for overnighting by the nobility and their entourage. During wartime or while on the run, they would camp under a clear sky, since there was no time to raise and tear down encampments. The noblemen’s armies also camped in places where the provincial militias would progressively gather, or where they awaited the arrival of reinforcements or allies. The longest lasting (sometimes up to several months) were encampments that lay siege to a stronghold or were on a riverbank, with the enemy ranks awaiting on the other side. &lt;br/&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;br/&gt;
Tents were built close together deliberately for security (mimicking walls). The first and largest tent in the centre of the camp belonged to the commander, nearby tents housed the nobles and high ranking soldiers, surrounded by simple shelters and huts for the ordinary soldiers and their horses. There was no need to camp together in one place, the army could make camp across several locations. In the larger camps there would be a field chapel, an infirmary to care for the wounded, or a makeshift brothel. &lt;br/&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;br/&gt;
Simple tents from the early Middle Ages were the shape of a capital ‘A’ with a square base and a distinctive central pole mounted on two upright stands. The tent canvas was most often made from flax or hemp, and undyed for ordinary soldiers, whilst variously coloured and decorated for the commander. They slept on the ground on mats, carpets or rugs, but the nobility and churchmen would have a travelling bed. &lt;br/&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;br/&gt;

Long-term camping was challenging logistically, supplies always being the responsibility of the nearest affiliated municipality head man. If the army was on hostile territory, it would send out provisioning detachments in search of procuring food and fuel. When supplies ran short it was time to move on to another location or give up the campaign. &lt;br/&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;br/&gt;
The worst thing was an outbreak of any epidemic in the camp, as hygiene was difficult to maintain. While waiting for developments there would also be quarrels, duels or fights, which could grow into a larger conflict, and significantly compromise the army. It was therefore, necessary to adjudge disputes and sometimes mete out severe punishments.

Although it resembles a catapult, its mechanism is different. The main contraption is a leverage mechanism with a counterweight on one side and a projectile sling on the other.

Tournaments were held by the nobility to celebrate the culmination of important political deals or special events, such as a coronation, Royal wedding or betrothal, oaths of loyalty, peace negotiations, etc. The aim was to prove the agility and combat technique, to show off to others and, often, to win a sizeable prize. Tournaments ranged from classic jousting, with Knights faced off against each other on horseback or on foot, or massed combat, with rival teams battling it out in the tournament arena. In both cases the aim was the same – to knock the opponent to the ground, but not to kill or injure him. Even so, injuries and deaths were not uncommon. &lt;br/&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;br/&gt;
Initially the Church rallied strongly against the tournaments – only in the 14th century did the Church lift the general ban on all participation and allowed them to be put on without sanction.

<Row><Cell>ui_codex_cont_winegrower</Cell><Cell>In Bohemia, wine-growing began to spread from the 10th century, and this especially for liturgical reasons. Between the 11th and 13th centuries, vineyards were mainly for monasteries and the nobility, generally in similar places to where we find wine grown today: mainly in South Moravia. Due to more favourable climatic conditions vineyards were able to grow even in Bohemia, but later, after a global cooling period they died off again. Taking care of vines kept vintners occupied all year round, the vintage harvest taking place from October to November, depending on the weather. 
&lt;br/&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;br/&gt;
Wine tended to be grown in places unsuitable for the cultivation of other plants, such as on the rocky south-facing slopes. It could take three to four years to establish a vineyard, and it would be good for thirty to forty years. The grapes were gathered and put into vats where they were crushed by treading. White grapes were pressed immediately after crushing and the juice kept in wooden barrels, tarred and sanitized with sulphur, where the wine was left to ferment. Red wine was crushed, rid of grape seeds and left to ferment in open vats, stirred regularly. This produced what is termed the ‘mash’, and after a few days this was pressed and the juice poured into barrels.
&lt;br/&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;br/&gt;
King Charles IV was a great wine-lover, who imported grapevines from France together with wine-growing know-how and granted numerous privileges to vintners.

Armour was crafted by plate-smiths or platners, helmers, most often from one piece of tempered sheet metal (skullcaps, sallets) or riveted together from several smaller pieces (kettle helms, great helms). The best armour of the early 15th century was considered to be that made in Germany and Italy. So-called ‘combination’ armour was used by heavy cavalry – it was based around chain-mail, supplemented by plate armour on the limbs and a lighter version of cuirass, a breastplate or just a quilted breastcoat. Some of the cuirass coats and breastplates included a hook where to support the knight’s spear in combat. If the armour lacked a hook, the spear or lance was lodged in the bouche, a notch in the shield, which covered the left arm controlling the reins and the lower part of the helmet.

The finished fields were cultivated by the ‘three-field system’ – a third of the land lay fallow for two years, to recover (it was resting), used for grazing cattle, thereby adding manure. It was then returned to use, tilled, while a different third was left to rest, which had been used for crops in the meantime. There was thus regular crop rotation, to save exhausting the soil. &lt;br/&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;br/&gt;
In the earliest times, ploughing was done with a simple hook, called and ard- or scratch-plough. Where the soil was stony, working with it was very hard. The tiller had to keep watching the hook and used great force to push into the ground. Similarly clumsy and imperfect were the ‘harrows’ of the time. After harrowing, any remaining clods of earth would be smashed up with a mattock or wooden mallet. This work was typically done by women and children. &lt;br/&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;br/&gt;

Over the centuries, however, the flourishing of their activities as merchants and financiers gave rise to protests from many social layers, in particular, from the Church. The Jews had indeed imported valuable gold and used it to barter for horses, furs or slaves. Their rights became progressively circumscribed: they could not buy land or a house, they had to lived in specially designated ghettos, were allowed to lend money at interest (usury), and to trade only where they were not in competition, whilst prohibited from working as craftsmen and farmers. The segregation of Jews was also underlined by enforced labelling: they had to wear, say, a yellow circle or yellow ribbon on their garments, or a specifically shaped hat, the women had to have a yellow ribbon in their hair and the men mandatory beards. No help came from the Church, which traditionally laid the blame on them for being the ‘killers of Christ’ and for keeping to pagan rituals. &lt;br/&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;br/&gt;

For example, Wenceslaus IV granted the Prague Jews the right to their own city within Prague, with its own wall and six gates, but even this failed to protect them from the pogrom in 1389, when the King was away on his travels.

<Row><Cell>ui_codex_cont_zivot_v_klast</Cell><Cell>Každý klášter, obzvlášť benediktinská řehole, se řídil konkrétními pravidly týkajícími se času, činností a místa v klášterní hierarchii. Kromě bohoslužby, zbožné četby a přepisování nebo zdobení knih, mniši hodně pracovali fyzicky. Podle roční doby se 6 až 8 hodin věnovali práci, 3,5 hodiny se modlili a 3,5 hodiny studovali. Zbytek času zabral odpočinek a krátký spánek. &lt;br/&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;br/&gt;
V klášterech se často nacházely školy pro mnichy a budoucí kněží, nechyběla tu ani medicínská a lékařská dílna. Kromě infirmaria pro řeholníky pomáhal často bratr infirmarius i mimo klášter, navštěvoval nemocné nebo zraněné v okolních vesnicích a městech. 
&lt;br/&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;br/&gt;
Celý den byl rozdělený modlitbami: cyklus začínal tzv. vigilií (bdění po půlnoci). Mezi 3 a 4 hodinou ráno před svítáním se konala první chórová bohoslužba – matutinum. Po nich následovala prima (v čase rovnodennosti připadla na 6 hodin ráno), poté tertia (9 hodin), sexta (poledne) a nona (3 hodiny odpoledne). Hodinu před západem slunce sloužil konvent nešpory a denní cyklus byl uzavřen kompletoriem, půl hodiny po západu slunce. &lt;br/&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;br/&gt;
Po ranní mši se komunita scházela v kapitulní síni, kde naslouchala textu vybranému z kapitoly z řehole. Pak následovalo kázání a debaty tykající se kláštera. Bratři se vyznávali ze svých hříchů, káli se anebo získávali pokání. Do polední mše (sexty) se věnovali práci nebo studiu.&lt;br/&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;br/&gt;
Každá řehole obsahovala především pokyny týkající se vnitřní organizace, zdůrazňovala se například poslušnost, mlčenlivost, střídmost v mluvení i jídle, milosrdenství, pokora a pohostinnost. 
&lt;br/&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;br/&gt;
Kláštery bývaly uzavřené, konkrétně mniši sv. Benedikta od svého vysvěcení nesměli udržovat žádný kontakt se světem. Žili jen v klauzuře (vnitřní uzavřená část kláštera), kam žádný laik nesměl a oni zas nesměli ven. Za zdmi kláštera strávili někteří celý svůj život. S venkovním světem komunikovali jen pověření starší mniši a bratři-laici, kteří mimo klauzuru zajišťovali provoz celého klášterního areálu.</Cell><Cell>Every monastery, especially those of the Benedictine Order, followed specific rules regarding allocation of time, activities and positions in the monastery hierarchy. In addition to worship, devotional reading and copying or illuminating books, the monks laboured physically. Depending on the time of year, they devoted between six and eight hours to labour, three and a half hours to prayer and an equal time to study. The remainder of the day was allocated for rest and short sleep. &lt;br/&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;br/&gt;
Monasteries often had seminaries for monks and future priests, as well as medicinal workshops. The Brother Infirmarius, the monk in charge of healing, worked not only in the monastery infirmary, but also helped outside the monastery, attending sick or wounded in neighbouring villages and towns.
&lt;br/&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;br/&gt;
The day was divided by prayers – the Liturgy of the Hours – consisting of seven offices, beginning with Matins (also called Vigils) after midnight, the first choral prayers, Lauds, were recited at dawn or between 3 am and 4 am, followed by Prime (at the time of the Equinox at 6 am), Terce (at 9 am), Sext at noon and None at around 3 o'clock in the afternoon; an hour before sunset the evening prayers, Vespers, were said and the daily cycle closed before bedtime, usually half an hour after sunset, with Compline. &lt;br/&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;br/&gt;
After morning mass, the community met in the Chapter House and listened to readings selected from chapters of the Rule, the order’s book of precepts and regulations. Then there was a sermon and debate concerning the monastery. The brothers confessed their sins and were rebuked or rebuked others. Until midday prayers (Sext), they worked or studied. &lt;br/&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;br/&gt;
The Rule primarily contained instructions concerning internal organization, emphasizing, for example, obedience, silence, temperance in speaking and eating, mercy, humility and hospitality.
&lt;br/&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;br/&gt;
The monasteries were closed from the outside. The monks of the Order of St. Benedict, especially, were forbidden all contact with the outside world since the Order’s inception. They lived only in the cloister (the inner inaccessible heart of the monastery). They were not allowed to leave it and neither could any layman enter there. Some spent their entire lives behind the monastery walls. Only entrusted elder monks and lay-brothers communicated with the outside world. They took care of the entire running of the monastery outside the cloister.

He didn’t enjoy the crown for long though, and died shortly after. &lt;br/&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;br/&gt;
Jobst was not only politically astute, but also a very thrifty governor - many rulers, including Sigismund himself, were financially indebted to him. In his day, it was said that it was Jobst, and not either Wenceslas or Sigismund, who was the true uncrowned sovereign of Bohemia. At the time our game takes place, however, he was in debt up to his ears.

Wenceslaus IV of Luxembourg was the son of the highly successful ruler Charles IV, he inherited the Bohemian throne and attained the German crown by election. However, he did not inherit his father's predisposition for ruling...
Already during his lifetime he was known for being a weak, idle and moody ruler who was afflicted with many ailments, as well as frustrations over meeting his royal obligations. This was the case even though he had been prepped for the crown since early childhood (he was crowned Bohemian King at the age of only two years). He was more interested in hunting, alcohol, courtesans and pleasures of the court. During his time as king, the lands of the Bohemian Crown went through several wars and conflicts, which involved his relatives – his own brother Sigismund and his cousins, the Moravian Margraves.  &lt;br/&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;br/&gt;  

The event that triggered the Margrave Wars was when Wenceslaus occupied the vacated estates of the Olomouc Archdiocese, which by law should have belonged to the nobles. Under the leadership of Jošta the Moravian lords joined with Sigismund  in open revolt against the king, which wasn't so much about the Olomouc estates but more about the legitimacy of the rule of Wenceslaus, who in the meantime had been stripped of the Imperial crown by the imperial electors for his incompetence and unwillingness to rule. Later he also indirectly lost the Czech crown when he made numerous concessions and awarded the nobles many privileges, de facto transferring the ruling power to them. His unwillingness to meet obligations resulted in his kidnapping twice (de facto removing him from the throne) – first in 1394 by the Czech nobles and then in 1402 by his brother Sigismund. &lt;br/&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;br/&gt;

Wenceslaus initially supported the reform proposals of Jan Hus and his adherents, but he did nothing to save his life when he was sentenced to be burned at the stake by the Church. He thus set in motion what was later to become the largest (and only more or less successful) popular revolt in Europe – the Hussite Wars. However, he did not live to see these events as he died in 1419. After his death, his brother Sigismund of Hungary seized the crown - but he had to fight for it since not everyone acknowledged his claim, and once he had the crown he did not enjoy it long.

Sbinco (Zbyněk) Zajíc of Haseburg, the son of William Zajíc of Hasenburg, was Prague Archbishop between 1403 and 1411, a member of the court of Wenceslas IV, the Provost of Mělník and a military leader. Although he was a supporter of Jan Hus at the outset of the 15th century, from 1407 onwards he was in public opposition to him. On 16 July 1410, he even burnt Wycliffe’s writings and placed John Hus under an interdict. This  met with protests not only from the citizens of Prague, but also from King Wenceslas IV himself, who demanded that the interdict be withdrawn. Sbinco rejected the demand and subsequently remained absent from the country for several years.&lt;br/&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;br/&gt;

<Row><Cell>ui_tutorial_cont_alchemy</Cell><Cell>Alchemy is a useful skill that transforms herbs and other ingredients into potions and remedies. In order to brew those, you need an knowledge of alchemy, a recipe, an alchemist’s bench and the necessary ingredients.&lt;br/&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;br/&gt;
In the alchemist’s lab you will find on the right side of the bench a herbarium, which lists all the properties of herbs and all the recipes you have so far learnt. You open the book with $use; a pomocí $read_toggle; and turn the pages to the recipe or plant description you want.&lt;br/&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;br/&gt;
It’s always best to follow the recipe in the book, By holding $use; on the recipe, you can also set all the necessary ingredients straight onto the alchemy bench.&lt;br/&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;br/&gt;
The degree of difficulty of the brewing itself varies and each recipe requires a variable number of steps. But the first step is always to pour the potion base, which you will find on the shelf on your left, into the cauldron. The next step is to add the ingredients to the cauldron and brew the mixture on the prescribed flame, which is regulated by means of the bellows $alch_use_bag;. You should carefully time how long you brew the potion using the sand-glass $alch_use_sandglass;. If the recipe demands it, you must take care to grind ingredients using the mortar and pestle. The brewed potion can then be poured directly from the cauldron into the phial, or passed through the distiller.&lt;br/&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;br/&gt;
The recipe steps must be adhered to precisely – if you deviate too much from them, the potion will fail, you’ll lose all your ingredients and the whole brewing process will have to be repeated.&lt;br/&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;br/&gt;
Once you’ve become skilled enough at alchemy, you’ll have the option of auto-brewing potions by holding $read_select2; on the herbarium.

The recipe steps must be adhered to precisely – if you deviate too much from them, the potion will fail, you’ll lose all your ingredients and the whole brewing process will have to be repeated.&lt;br/&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;br/&gt;
Once you’ve become skilled enough at alchemy, you’ll have the option of auto-brewing potions by holding $read_select2; on the Herbarium.

In a fistfight, this control executes a right or left hook to the head, in armed combat a slashing strike.&lt;br/&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;br/&gt;
Using $attack2; you attack with a faster, but weaker strike. In unarmed combat that means a jab to the face, with a weapon a stab with the point of the blade.&lt;br/&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;br/&gt;
You can block any strike that comes from in front with $block; For a normal block, you don’t have to hold your weapon in the same zone that your opponent is aiming at.&lt;br/&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;br/&gt;
You can kick your opponent away using $attack3; If you’re close to your adversary, you can use  $attack3; to cross weapons with him and get in a clinch.&lt;br/&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;br/&gt;

The red bar shows your level of [Health], the yellow  your [Stamina]. The purple bar shows roughly how much life your opponent has left.
Every strike executed costs stamina. Once it’s completely depleted, you can’t attack again until it regenerates. Stamina also functions as a shield of sorts. As well as strikes, blocking also depletes stamina. The stronger the opponent’s strike, the harder it is to block and the more stamina is costs. Once your stamina is gone, hits taken will cost you health, even if you block them. If your opponent is very strong, or if you don’t succeed in blocking, his strikes will deplete your health along you’re your stamina. 
A big impact on your health can wound you and cause bleeding. Wounded limbs will incapacitate you and bleeding can result in death.

You can take the edge of a foe’s strikes by wearing armour. The better the armour, the less health and stamina his strikes will cost you. You can also save some stamina by using a shield to block. If you’re wearing plate armour and carrying a shield, sometimes that alone will save you without having to defend yourself actively, especially against a less experienced opponent. On the contrary, if your foe is in plate armour, you’ll have to wear him down and exhaust him before you can cause him any real damage.
The best weapons to use against armour are those with high blunt impact (maces, axes, hammers), while against a lightly armoured opponent it’s better to use a weapon with a higher level of slashing and stabbing power (swords, sabres).
You’ll know you’re in combat or someone is about to attack you from the crossed swords icon beneath the compass at the top of the screen. During combat, you can switch weapons in your inventory; you can’t change your armour or eat to recover health.

<Row><Cell>ui_tutorial_cont_dice</Cell><Cell>If you want to try your hand at gambling, it’s possible to play the dice game of Farkle in every respectable tavern.&lt;br/&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;br/&gt;
The goal of this two-player game is to be the first to reach a certain number of points.&lt;br/&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;br/&gt;
Six dice are thrown and the players alternate turns. Points are gained for every one or five thrown, and for three or more of a kind of any other number. Scoring is as follows:&lt;br/&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;br/&gt;
• a single [1] is worth 100 points;&lt;br/&gt;
• a single [5] is worth 50 points;&lt;br/&gt;
• [three of a kind] is worth 100 points multiplied by the given number, e.g. three 4s are worth 400 points;&lt;br/&gt;
• [three 1s] are worth 1,000 points;&lt;br/&gt;
• [four or more of a kind] is worth double the points of three of a kind, so four 4s are worth 800 points, five 4s are worth 1,600 points etc.&lt;br/&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;br/&gt;
A player's turn always begins by throwing all six dice. The player then uses $dice_hold; to select and set aside scoring dice, and at least one die must always be set aside. Then the player can throw the remaining dice again using $dice_score; and the situation repeats. Scoring combinations are counted only for the current throw, not the entire turn.&lt;br/&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;br/&gt;
The key element of the game is that if a throw does not produce a single scoring die, then the player's turn is over and all points scored up to that throw are forfeit. It is then the opposing player's turn to throw. For that reason, it’s best to end your turn using $dice_pass; before the risk that not a single die will score gets too high. Sometimes it’s better not to set aside all the scoring dice you’ve thrown, so you stand a better chance of scoring higher on the next throw.&lt;br/&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;br/&gt;
Since each player uses his own dice, there’s also an opportunity to cheat. But finding loaded dice isn’t so easy.

<Row><Cell>ui_tutorial_cont_lockpicking</Cell><Cell>In order to pick locks, you must have at least one lockpick in your inventory, although it’s better to have one or two spares, since they get worn with use and in the worst case can break.

You start the actual lockpicking process by holding $use; on the lock. You will then see a diagram of the lock mechanism, in which you have to find the right spot to insert the lockpick. How close you are to the sweet spot is indicated by the size of the cursor, and it turns gold when you find it.&lt;br/&gt;

Then you have to use the lockpick {$lock_dir_fwd;|$xi_lock_dir_help;} to turn the whole lock mechanism. At the same time, you have to coordinate the movement of the lockpick with the rotation of the mechanism, because the rotation shifts the position of the sweet spot and you have to adjust accordingly.&lt;br/&gt;

If you try to turn the mechanism without having the lockpick in the correct position, the mechanism will stick, which will damage the lockpick or even break it. Any damage to the lockpick will produce a noise, which can draw unwanted attention, and breaking it will cause an even louder snap.

&amp;lt;p align='center'&amp;gt;&amp;lt;img src='img://Libs/UI/Textures/Dynamic/611.dds' width='64' height='64' &amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&lt;br/&gt;
Of course, it's not entirely easy to learn from books - to fully understand the text, you have to have very good reading skills and read books repeatedly. The quality of your reading is also influenced by the environment you read in. Generally speaking, a place that's good for rest is also good for study. You can tell you've found a suitable place from the icon that appears next to your Health indicator:&lt;br/&gt;&amp;lt;p align='center'&amp;gt;&amp;lt;img src='img://Libs/UI/Textures/Dynamic/ico_reading_buff.dds' width='64' height='66' &amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

<Row><Cell>ui_tutorial_cont_repair</Cell><Cell>Your weapons, armour, clothing and other equipment become worn out and damaged with use. How quickly and easily depends not only on the quality of the items themselves, but also on how you use them. Wear and tear will be less if you don’t let yourself get hacked to ribbons in combat, and the more skilled you are at using weapons, the less you’ll blunt and damage them in combat. So, like every good soldier, you should check on the condition of the equipment in your Inventory {$ui_toggle_inventory;|$ui_open_inventory;} from time to time and repair or replace things that aren’t up to scratch, which you will see from the lower number in the Quality column &amp;lt;img src='img://Libs/UI/Textures/Dynamic/inventory_health.dds' width='42' height='42' &amp;gt;. If items are severely damaged, the value is shown in orange, while red numbers indicate a critical condition. Bloodied or dirty items are indicated by labels on their icons:&lt;br/&gt;&amp;lt;p align='center'&amp;gt;&amp;lt;img src='img://Libs/UI/Textures/Dynamic/ico_item_blood.dds' width='64' height='64' &amp;gt; &amp;lt;img src='img://Libs/UI/Textures/Dynamic/ico_item_dirt.dds' width='64' height='64' &amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&lt;br/&gt;It’s best to have your equipment repaired by experts. A swordsmith will grind the nicks out of your sword edge, a plate armourer will beat the dents out of your cuirass and even a regular blacksmith can handle light repairs. You can take your ripped clothing to a tailor and scuffed boots to a cobbler, while the wenches at any bathhouse will wash the dirt and dried blood out of your clothes.&lt;br/&gt;
&amp;lt;p align='center'&amp;gt;&amp;lt;img src='img://Libs/UI/Textures/Dynamic/icon_map_weaponsmith.dds' width='64' height='64' &amp;gt; &amp;lt;img src='img://Libs/UI/Textures/Dynamic/icon_map_armourer.dds' width='64' height='64' &amp;gt;&amp;lt;img src='img://Libs/UI/Textures/Dynamic/icon_map_blacksmith.dds' width='64' height='64' &amp;gt;&amp;lt;img src='img://Libs/UI/Textures/Dynamic/icon_map_tailor.dds' width='64' height='64' &amp;gt;&amp;lt;img src='img://Libs/UI/Textures/Dynamic/icon_map_shoemaker.dds' width='64' height='64' &amp;gt;&amp;lt;img src='img://Libs/UI/Textures/Dynamic/icon_map_baths.dds' width='64' height='64' &amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
&lt;br/&gt;Of course, when you’re in the field pursuing an important mission, you won’t always have time to go to town and avail of the benefits of civilization. So, it’s wise to carry with you repair kits for your equipment – there’s one for arms, one for armour, one for clothing and another for footwear. Of course, you need to be able to use them, which means acquiring the skill of [Maintenance]. If your skill level is high enough, all you have to do is use the appropriate repair kit in the Inventory {$ui_toggle_inventory;|$ui_open_inventory;} on the damaged part of the equipment you want to fix.&lt;br/&gt;
&amp;lt;p align='center'&amp;gt;&amp;lt;img src='img://Libs/UI/Textures/Dynamic/repairkit1.dds' width='64' height='64' &amp;gt; &amp;lt;img src='img://Libs/UI/Textures/Dynamic/repairkit3.dds' width='64' height='64' &amp;gt; &amp;lt;img src='img://Libs/UI/Textures/Dynamic/repairkit4.dds' width='64' height='64' &amp;gt; &amp;lt;img src='img://Libs/UI/Textures/Dynamic/repairkit2.dds' width='64' height='64' &amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&lt;br/&gt;If you want to maintain bladed weapons, you can save your repair kit and hone it yourself on a grinding wheel, which you can find at every smithy.&lt;br/&gt;
&amp;lt;p align='center'&amp;gt;&amp;lt;img src='img://Libs/UI/Textures/Dynamic/icon_map_sharpening_wheel.dds' width='64' height='64' &amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
To hone your weapon, approach the grinding wheel, start the process $use; and select from the list which weapon you want to hone.&lt;br/&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;br/&gt;
The weapon must be honed along the whole length of the blade: you select which part using {$sword_position;|$xi_sword_position_r;}.&lt;br/&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;br/&gt;The blade must be held at the correct angle to the grinding wheel – if the angle is too shallow, the edge won’t be sharpened; if it’s too steep, you can dull the blade even more. You control the angle using {$sword_rotation;|$xi_sword_rotation;}.&lt;br/&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;br/&gt;You must also exert the correct pressure to make sure you hone the edge at all (pressing also depletes your stamina) using {$sword_pressure_up; and release it with $sword_pressure_down;|$xi_sword_pressure;}.&lt;br/&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;br/&gt;At the same time, you have to keep the grinding wheel turning using $xi_pedaling;.&lt;br/&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;br/&gt;You can recognise correct honing by flying sparks, whereas black smoke coming from under the blade tells you you’re damaging it. A well-honed blade is smooth and shiny.&lt;br/&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;br/&gt;When you’re dirty, you don’t have to rush immediately to the nearest bathhouse – you can have a quick wash by pressing $use; on the nearest water trough.

This is indicated by the punishment icon reappearing next to the compass on your return.&lt;br/&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;br/&gt;When the catchpoles catch you, unless they want to kill you outright, they will confiscate all your loot and impose a penalty for all your known infringements of the law. Once you accept your punishment, all your known felonies in the location will deleted. If you find the punishment too harsh, you can try talking your way out of it. And if that doesn’t work, you can always resist arrest or take to your heels. Although once you take that course of action, the guards will take a harsher approach and try to stop you by force.&lt;br/&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;br/&gt;Your last option is to accept a jail sentence and serve the time for your crime. The downside to that is that rotting in a dungeon won’t benefit your health much.&lt;br/&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;br/&gt;The best way to avoid confrontation with the law is to keep your nose clean.

<Row><Cell>ui_tutorial_cont_shop</Cell><Cell>Launching shopping opens a special window that looks like a regular inventory window, but has only three tabs:&lt;br/&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;br/&gt;
[Buy] contains all the goods in the vendor’s inventory.&lt;br/&gt;
[Sell] shows all the items in your inventory that you can sell to the trader in question. Bear in mind that traders only buy the type of goods they deal in.&lt;br/&gt;
[Basket], contains all the items you’ve selected either to buy or sell before finalising the deal.&lt;br/&gt;
&amp;lt;p align='center'&amp;gt;&amp;lt;img src='img://Libs/UI/Textures/Dynamic/shop_tabs.dds' width='405' height='128' &amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&lt;br/&gt;

Next to the tabs is a window with a summary of information about the trade:&lt;br/&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;br/&gt;
[Your Reputation] shows your reputation with the present trader. The higher it is, the better your chances of getting a good price.&lt;br/&gt;
[Trader’s Capital] shows the total sum of money the trader has, and therefore the most that you can get by selling to him or her.&lt;br/&gt;
[Buying items for] shows the total value of the things you want to buy.&lt;br/&gt;
[Selling items for] shows the total value of the things you want to sell.&lt;br/&gt;
[You pay] shows how much you’ll pay for the goods you selected (a minus figure means you will get the amount). If the total price is shown in red, either you or the trader does not have enough money to close the deal. &lt;br/&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;br/&gt;
You can only close the deal using the Basket. You can adjust what you have in it, change the quantity of each item or put things back using $ui_reset;.&lt;br/&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;br/&gt;
Stiskem $ui_accept; confirms the deal. If either you or the trader does not have enough coin, the trade will not proceed and you must adjust the items in your Basket.&lt;br/&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;br/&gt;
If you’re not satisfied with the final price (or you’re a little short of coin), you can hold $ui_accept; to haggle over the price.&lt;br/&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;br/&gt;
[Haggling]&lt;br/&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;br/&gt;
Haggling works in both directions – whether you want to buy cheap or sell dear. In both cases, the bar is set with the best price for you at the bottom, the usual price in the middle and above it space for adding a tip to the trader when buying, or a discount when selling. If you or the trader doesn’t have enough money, the actual amount you have will replace the figures on the bar.&lt;br/&gt;
&amp;lt;p align='center'&amp;gt;&amp;lt;img src='img://Libs/UI/Textures/Dynamic/haggle_tutorial.dds' width='128' height='371' &amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&lt;br/&gt;
You select the amount you want you want to give or receive {$ui_up;|$ui_dp_up;} a {$ui_down;|$ui_dp_down;} and confirm with $use;. The trader will then respond to your offer. If the answer is a refusal, he or she will make a counter-offer and wait for your response.&lt;br/&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;br/&gt;
It’s always best to start haggling with a much higher or lower price than you expect to achieve. But you shouldn’t overdo it, because you can annoy your counterpart and end the haggling before it even starts. Even then, you must adhere to the unwritten laws of haggling.&lt;br/&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;br/&gt;
What’s more, dragging out the haggling with one offer after another will gradually try the trader’s patience and when they get really annoyed, they’ll drop the haggling completely and there will be no deal. You can see how close you’re getting to that point from the trader icon below the bar: the more gold there is in the background, the closer the trader is to dropping the haggling.&lt;br/&gt;
&amp;lt;p align='center'&amp;gt;&amp;lt;img src='img://Libs/UI/Textures/Dynamic/haggle_angry.dds' width='256' height='85' &amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&lt;br/&gt;
Every unsuccessful bout of haggling lowers your reputation with the trader. On the contrary, if you tip the trader or give him or her a discount, your reputation will improve.

[Haggling]&lt;br/&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;br/&gt;
Haggling works in both directions – whether you want to buy cheap or sell dear. In both cases, the bar is always set with the best price for you at the bottom, the usual price in the middle and above it scope for adding a tip to the trader when buying, or a discount when selling. If you or the trader doesn’t have enough money, the actual amount you have will replace the figures on the bar.&lt;br/&gt;
&amp;lt;p align='center'&amp;gt;&amp;lt;img src='img://Libs/UI/Textures/Dynamic/haggle_tutorial.dds' width='128' height='371' &amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&lt;br/&gt;
You select the amount you want to give or receive {$ui_up;|$ui_dp_up;} a {$ui_down;|$ui_dp_down;} and confirm with $use; The trader will then respond to your offer. If the answer is a refusal, he or she will make a counter-offer and wait for your response.&lt;br/&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;br/&gt;
It’s always best to start haggling with a much higher or lower price than you expect to achieve. But you shouldn’t overdo it, because you can annoy your counterpart and end the haggling before it even starts. Even then, you must adhere to the unwritten laws of haggling.&lt;br/&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;br/&gt;
What’s more, dragging out the haggling with one offer after another will gradually try the trader’s patience and when they get really annoyed, they’ll drop the haggling completely and there will be no deal. You can see how close you’re getting to that point from the trader icon below the bar: the more gold there is in the background, the closer the trader is to dropping the haggling.&lt;br/&gt;
&amp;lt;p align='center'&amp;gt;&amp;lt;img src='img://Libs/UI/Textures/Dynamic/haggle_angry.dds' width='256' height='85' &amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&lt;br/&gt;
Every unsuccessful bout of haggling lowers your reputation with the trader. On the contrary, if you tip the trader or give him or her a discount, your reputation will improve.

<Row><Cell>ui_tutorial_cont_stats</Cell><Cell>During the course of the game, Henry will improve his stats, which you can find in the Player tab{ $ui_toggle_player;| $ui_open_inventory; $ui_controller_shoulder_r1;}. These improvements come automatically simply by playing and all can be developed to the maximum. There are no obstacles or situations that would prevent such improvements of selected abilities.&lt;br/&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;br/&gt;
With levelling-up of the given stats, you will get the option to select one of the perks that in some way improves an ability or changes the way it functions.

&amp;lt;img src='img://Libs/UI/Textures/Dynamic/ico_player_strength.dds' width='64' height='64' &amp;gt; Strength defines how well Henry can handle physical challenges. Greater strength makes it possible to wield heavier weapons and wear heavier armour. Each level-up also significantly increases the capacity of your inventory.

&amp;lt;img src='img://Libs/UI/Textures/Dynamic/ico_player_agility.dds' width='64' height='64' &amp;gt; Agility is a measure of speed, movement and dexterity. A more agile character can not only move faster, but also more easily evade attacks, fight more skilfully with demanding weapons, such as a sabre, and shoot better with a bow. Archery, like other forms of combat, increases agility.&lt;br/&gt;
&amp;lt;img src='img://Libs/UI/Textures/Dynamic/ico_player_vitality.dds' width='64' height='64' &amp;gt; Vitality influences the character’s endurance – how much wounding he can endure, how long he can sprint and how often he needs to eat or sleep. With increased vitality, stamina and its speed of regeneration also grow. You can train your vitality by running, overcoming physical obstacles and demanding combat.&lt;br/&gt;
&amp;lt;img src='img://Libs/UI/Textures/Dynamic/ico_player_speech.dds' width='64' height='64' &amp;gt; Speech determines the character’s rhetorical skill and eloquence. The more Henry talks to people, the more eloquent he becomes. Becoming a better speaker means you can avoid conflicts before they even start, your haggling is more efficient and you can disarm someone by argument who you wouldn’t be able to beat in combat.&lt;br/&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;br/&gt;

&amp;lt;p align='center'&amp;gt;&amp;lt;img src='img://Libs/UI/Textures/Dynamic/ico_player_stealth.dds' width='64' height='64' &amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&lt;br/&gt;
Skill alone won't make you invisible, though. If you stand out like a sore thumb, or rattle like a tinker's wagon, you're bound to get caught. You have to take care that no one sees or hears you.&lt;br/&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;br/&gt;
To stay out of sight, it helps to crouch $toggle_crouch;. But that in itself is not enough. Crouching in the middle of the town square in broad daylight is more likely to attract attention than to avoid it!&lt;br/&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;br/&gt;
To make yourself less noticeable, you should choose appropriate clothing for the situation. Black clothing at night will make you less visible, but in broad daylight will more likely attract suspicion.&lt;br/&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;br/&gt;
And of course you don't want to be heard either. The right footwear will dampen the sound of your footsteps even on a noisy surface, and the less metal elements you have in your attire, the less you will jingle. It's also important to avoid noisy actions, such as breaking a lockpick or starting a dog barking.&lt;br/&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;br/&gt;
Your chances of successful stealth can be determined from the stats [Visibility], [Conspic(uousness)] and [Noise], which depend on the properties of the individual items of your attire - the lower the value, the better. You'll find these in the table beneath the figure of Henry.&lt;br/&gt;
&amp;lt;p align='center'&amp;gt;&amp;lt;img src='img://Libs/UI/Textures/Dynamic/ico_player_visibility.dds' width='64' height='64' &amp;gt; &amp;lt;img src='img://Libs/UI/Textures/Dynamic/ico_player_conspic.dds' width='64' height='64' &amp;gt; &amp;lt;img src='img://Libs/UI/Textures/Dynamic/ico_player_noise.dds' width='64' height='64' &amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&lt;br/&gt;
There's more than one way to skin a cat, of course. If you can get hold of the outfit of a particular faction, you can skip the stealth altogether and walk boldly into places where you would otherwise be very unwelcome. The more items of the other faction's attire you have on you, the more inconspicuous you'll be. The most convincing garments are ones that stand out, such as a tabard, and helmets that cover your face.
</Cell><Cell>In these harsh times, people are wary of anything out of the ordinary. If you step inside someone's house uninvited, for example, they will first [warn] you that you've no business there, but if you do anything untoward there, they will immediately call for a guard.&lt;br/&gt;

You'd better not get caught at all in sensitive places like the armoury or some noble's chambers. If that happens, there'll be no warning at all and the catchpoles will immediately try to place you under [arrest].&lt;br/&gt;

Life is God’s gift and combat doesn’t always have to end in death! So when it’s clear that a combatant is beaten, he always has the option to surrender honourably, and the honourable response is to accept his surrender.&lt;br/&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;br/&gt;
If someone yields to your mercy, it’s up to you to decide how to deal with them. You can simply let them go, or refuse to accept the surrender and finish the fight. Another option common in the middle ages is to accept your opponent’s surrender for a price – either money or equipment.&lt;br/&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;br/&gt;
Similarly, you can also surrender in combat using {$surrender;|$surrender_xi_modifier;+$surrender_xi_activate;} and hope your opponent respects knightly virtues.&lt;br/&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;br/&gt;
[Surrendering to Guards]&lt;br/&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;br/&gt;
If a guard, catchpole or other figure of authority challenges you to surrender or to agree to a personal search, you can do so using {$surrender;|$surrender_xi_modifier;+$surrender_xi_activate;}. But you’d better decide quick, because the guardians of the law have little patience in these troubled times and they won’t hesitate to use force if you don’t cooperate.
